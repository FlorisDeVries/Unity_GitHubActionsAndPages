## Overview
This project is created as an experiment to show the build and publish capabilities of GitHub actions for a Unity project.
Each time a new PR is merged into master the `some-pipeline-name` workflow will trigger, building and publishing the Unity project for WebGL (GitHub pages).

## Features
- **Unity sandbox**: A minimal Unity project is included, where the player can push some 0-friction blocks around with WASD.
- **CI/CD**: `some-pipeline-name` automatically builds and deploys the game to GitHub pages, when a new version is available on the `main` branch.

## Setup instructions
If you would like to apply this simple workflow to your Unity project, follow these steps:
1. **Unity Settings**: Brotli compression format
